## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications.
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

## My process

  I first started out be studying the screenshots provided in the challenge and mapping out the best, clean and efficient way of structuring and writing the HTML code. After that step, i went ahead to start writing code while paying close attention to correctly add a link tag to elements that are links, adding Classes and IDs to elements that will need then when i begin styling later on. I also made sure i wrote code that another developer would be able to easily interprete.

 After coding the HTML, i went ahead to add custom styling using CSS. I added styles to the page as specified in the screenshot. Making sure to be as concise and direct with the styling as much as possible to avoid using 5 lines of code for a style that can be done in one.

 When i finished coding the HTML & CSS, then came Javascript. As part of the challenge requires that the site should be able to update whenever a viewer click/tries to view a notification by reducing the number of notification count.
